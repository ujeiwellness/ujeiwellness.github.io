                              <p>Infrared therapy has many roles in the human body. These include detoxification, pain relief, reduction of muscle tension, relaxation, improved circulation, weight loss, skin purification, lowered side effects of diabetes, boosting of the immune system and lowering of blood pressure. The infrared radiation hidden inside our machines widens blood vessels and helps remove toxins from the body by penetrating deeper layers of the skin. Doing so extends natural sweating and lets the body get rid of large amounts of accumulated toxins deposited in the deeper layers of the skin. </p>

            <p>The speed on Body Roll machines can be increased/decreased based off of your bodies needs. During rolling, it is common to experience an itching sensation from the blood vessels expanding due to the infrared light.</p>
            <p>Additionally, light bruising and/or soreness is common after rolling, but can be reduced by putting less body pressure into the machine.</p>
